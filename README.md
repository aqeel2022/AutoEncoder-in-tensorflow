Autoencoder
An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network that is trained to reconstruct its own input data. It is composed of two parts: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation, while the decoder tries to reconstruct the original data from this representation.

The encoder and decoder are usually implemented as neural networks with multiple layers. In a typical setup, the input data is fed into the encoder, which applies a series of transformations to it, gradually reducing its dimensionality. The resulting compressed representation is then fed into the decoder, which applies a series of transformations to it, gradually increasing its dimensionality until the original data is reconstructed.
